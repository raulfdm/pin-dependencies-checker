## Why

When installing dependencies without specifying a version, package managers (yarn, npm, pnpm, etc.) will, by default, install the latest published version with a caret `^`:

```bash
pnpm add lodash
```

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": "^4.17.21"
  }
}
```

This is termed a "ranged" version.

In the lock file, it will be registered that `lodash` is installed on version `4.17.21` OR HIGHER... and this is where issues arise.

Suppose lodash `4.18.0` is released, and it removes or alters an API our codebase depends on. If I need to regenerate my `lockfile` for any reason, the package manager will again fetch the latest version 4 of `lodash`. Instead of installing `4.17.21`, it will fetch the new `4.18.0`.

If we have unit tests, builds, etc., we'll likely encounter issues without understanding the cause. Our package.json hasn't changed, right? However, it's the `lockfile` that determines which dependencies get installed.

One way to ensure consistent versions is to avoid installing ranged versions. This can be achieved in various ways depending on the package manager:

```bash
pnpm add --save-exact lodash
```

Or, using pnpm, it can be defined in `.npmrc`:

```
save-prefix=''
```

Alternatively, you can use this tool as a pre-commit reminder to assess all dependencies you've installed and check for ranged versions. ðŸ˜…

## How it Works

The process is straightforward:

1. Scan all `package.json` files in the current work directory.
2. Identify all dependencies with a caret (`^`).
3. If any are found, the CLI will list them and exit with an error.
4. Otherwise, it will exit successfully.

## Getting Started

You can use this CLI directly from the registry via [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx) or [`pnpm dlx`](https://pnpm.io/cli/dlx):

```bash
pnpm dlx pin-dependencies-checker

# OR using npm

npx pin-dependencies-checker
```

Alternatively, add it to your project's dev dependencies:

```bash
pnpm add --save-exact --save-dev pin-dependencies-checker
# Or the equivalent command for your package manager
```

Then run:

```bash
pnpm pin-checker
# Or for npm or yarn
npx pin-checker
```

### Git Hooks

You can automate the CLI execution using a git hook (e.g., pre-commit).

Many JS projects use [`husky`](https://github.com/typicode/husky) for this purpose.

Simply add the command to your `pre-commit` script:

```bash
# Other commands and setup
pnpm pin-checker

# Or using npx
npx pin-checker
```

## Arguments

By default, this CLI scans only `dependencies` and `devDependencies`. This behavior can be modified with CLI arguments.

### `--no-deps`

> Default: false

Skips the `dependencies` evaluation:

```bash
pnpm pin-checker --no-deps
```

### `--no-dev-deps`

> Default: false

Skips the `devDependencies` evaluation:

```bash
pnpm pin-checker --no-dev-deps
```

### `--peer-deps`

> Default: false

Evaluates `peerDependencies`:

> **NOTE**
> Peer dependencies are primarily for libraries, indicating to the package manager the necessary version for the library to function correctly. You likely don't want to verify this.

```bash
pnpm pin-checker --peer-deps
```

### `--optional-deps`

> Default: false

Evaluates [`optionalDependencies`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json#optionaldependencies):

```bash
pnpm pin-checker --optional-deps
```

## Contributing

To run this project, you'll need:

- Node 20 or higher
- pnpm

After cloning, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

You can either link the package globally or run the command:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will evaluate the current repository, which can be handy for quick tests.

To run unit tests:

```bash
pnpm run test
```
